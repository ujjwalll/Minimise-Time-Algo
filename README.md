# Minimise-Time-Algo
It is a algoritm in python that we (My Team) made during a hackathon.
It function is to reduce the time taken by restrounts to deliver food 
by providing them a optimised algorithm which tells the chef/cook
that what he/she has to made so that they can complete their all 
orders in minimum time.

#How to Use it

It is a hard-coded version in which you have to enter the time you 
require to make te specific food otem and it will accordingly adjust
itself, You can also provide your google API so that it can show
the status of your food and its estimated delivery time.
